			Hello

		<p>
			This is the landing page! Welcome.

		<h2>
			Using the website

		<h3>
			User scopes
		</h3>

		<p>
			All users can view rooms; only admin users can create new rooms, edit, and delete rooms. Contact me to upgrade you to admin.

			Rooms

		<p>
			This is the page where things happen!
		</p>
			<br />
			You can try the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Rooms
					<br />
					Click on one of the tags in Rooms to filter by that tag
				</li>
				<li>
					Rooms >> {click any room}
					<br />
					Click the 'More info' button when viewing a room to see things like its rating, environment, and whether or not darkvision or a grid are required. Open this menu while editing to change these values!
				</li>
				<li>
					Rooms >> {Create new room button}
					<br />
					Create a new room using the currently super crappy new room form! Then, add the information that I haven't included in the form by navigating to the new room and clicking 'Edit'. Or, delete it and see it disappear!
				</li>
			</ul>
